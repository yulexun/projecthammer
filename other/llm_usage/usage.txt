Prompt: I have data that can come in this structure "6un", "12 eggs", "30eggs" (and other structures) and I need to write a sqlite cast statment in a select that only gets the numbers, how to. Keep in mind that numbers are either from 0-99 (meaning only one or two digits)

Response: To extract the number from a string that can have various structures like "6un", "12 eggs", or "30eggs", and where the number is guaranteed to be between 0 and 99 (one or two digits), you can use SQLite string functions to isolate the numeric part from the rest of the string.

Hereâ€™s a solution using CAST, SUBSTR, and INSTR to extract the leading numeric part of the string:

Query Example:
sql
Copy code
SELECT 
    my_column,
    CAST(SUBSTR(my_column, 1, 
        CASE 
            WHEN INSTR(my_column, ' ') > 0 THEN INSTR(my_column, ' ') - 1
            ELSE LENGTH(my_column)
        END
    ) AS INTEGER) AS extracted_number
FROM 
    my_table;
Explanation:
INSTR(my_column, ' '): Finds the position of the first space in the string. If there is no space (like in "6un" or "30eggs"), it will return 0.
SUBSTR(my_column, 1, ...): Extracts the substring starting from position 1 (the beginning of the string), up to the first non-numeric character (space, or end of the string if no space exists). This gives you just the numeric part.
CAST(... AS INTEGER): Converts the substring (which is still a string) to an integer.
Examples:
Input: "6un"

INSTR('6un', ' ') returns 0 (no space).
SUBSTR('6un', 1, 2) extracts "6".
CAST('6' AS INTEGER) gives 6.
Input: "12 eggs"

INSTR('12 eggs', ' ') returns 3 (position of space).
SUBSTR('12 eggs', 1, 2) extracts "12".
CAST('12' AS INTEGER) gives 12.
Input: "30eggs"

INSTR('30eggs', ' ') returns 0 (no space).
SUBSTR('30eggs', 1, 2) extracts "30".
CAST('30' AS INTEGER) gives 30.
Handling More Complex Cases:
If you need to handle additional edge cases (e.g., strings with characters other than spaces between the number and the units), you could adapt the query further by detecting where the number ends (e.g., using a regex-like approach, though SQLite doesn't have full regex support). The current approach should work fine for cases with spaces or characters at the end.

Notes:
The number is always assumed to be at the start of the string and is between 0-99 digits.
This query works for strings where the number is followed by spaces or alphanumeric characters.
If there are additional complex cases (e.g., mixed numbers), further parsing logic could be added.
Let me know if you'd like to refine this further!
